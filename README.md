## Description

The Degen Token project involves creating an ERC-20 token on the Avalanche blockchain. The token can be earned, traded, and redeemed by players for in-game rewards. This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic ERC-20 token with functionalities such as minting, transferring, checking balances, and burning tokens.

   git clone https://github.com/qeewpi/DegenToken.git
   cd DegenToken
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   SNOWTRACE_API_KEY=your_snowtrace_api_key
   ```

### Executing Program

1. **Compile the Smart Contract:**
